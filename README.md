# BoplAudioController
A bopl mod to manage the audio playing during matches, can add custom audios in the config file in the CustomSongs folder (must be mp3s)

Example 1: [Here](https://github.com/maxgamertyper/BoplAudioController/blob/main/audiocontrollernew.mp4) and [Here](https://youtu.be/56GsfJ_AKtc)

Update 1.0.1: made it so the gui doesnt reset on new round and the pause button is accurate after resetting matches
